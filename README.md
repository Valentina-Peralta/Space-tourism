## Technologies Used
The project is built with React. To provide a truly immersive experience, I utilized React Three Fiber for creating realistic 3D visuals.

## Work in progress
The following improvements are planned for the project:

- Implement animations using GSAP for enhanced visual effects.
- Add more 3D objects for a realistic experience.
